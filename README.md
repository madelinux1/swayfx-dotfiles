# Madelinux's SwayFX dotfiles
These are just my dotfiles for SwayFX. The theme is mostly Catppuccin Latte with some of the colors from Macchiato.
The wallpaper is by u/MoeWanders on Reddit.
This contains themes for
- SwayFX
- Mako
- Fastfetch
- Waybar
- Fuzzel
- Kitty
<p>If you would like configs for anything else just create an issue and I'll probably add it.<br>
Keep in mind you will have to edit the config to use your preferred browser if it's not Firefox.<br>
Also I have only tested this on Arch Linux and I see no reason why it wouldn't work on other distros but just keep in mind that it wasn't tested on anything else.</p>
